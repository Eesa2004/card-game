# Card Game

A complex single-player card game built with Python and object-oriented programming (OOP).


## Game Rules

- The game is played with a standard deck of cards.
- The player starts with a shuffled deck and draws a hand of cards at the beginning of their turn.
- Each turn, the player may perform the following actions:
- Draw a card from the deck.
- Play a card from their hand based on valid moves.
- Activate special effects if a special card is played.
- Win condition: The player wins by completing the objective (e.g., clearing all cards, reaching a target score, or another win scenario specific to your implementation).
- Loss condition: The game ends if the player cannot make any valid moves or meets the loss criteria (e.g., deck runs out, certain penalty cards played).
- Special cards may have unique effects, such as skipping turns, drawing extra cards, or reversing play order.
- All moves are validated by the game engine to ensure fairness and adherence to rules.
- The game is designed to be extensible, allowing for new rules or card types to be added easily.e codebase is modular, extensible, and showcases robust game logic and mechanics.
